# Overview
:::{hint} Learning Objectives
* Students will demonstrate proficiency in the observation, analysis, and interpretation of experimental data, including the role that uncertainty plays in interpreting experimental results.
* Students operate signal generators and oscilloscopes to set up experiments in with transistors.
* Students analyze data related to transistor circuits.
* Students articulate results of these experiments including experimental uncertainty.
