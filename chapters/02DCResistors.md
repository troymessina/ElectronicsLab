# Introduction

All of the experiments will have a virtual component to accompany the work on the lab bench. The virtual experiments are done using the PhET simulator below. Click on the "Lab" tab.

#Background
Ohmâ€™s Law says $V = IR$, or voltage equals the current times the resistance. $V$ is in Volts (Volts are Joules/Coulomb). $I$ is in amperes (or Coulomb per second), and $R$ is in Ohms (units you could work out from the others). These are SI units. Voltage, also called electric potential, is the source of energy pushing electrons through a typical circuit. Flowing charges, or current, is a result of the voltage pushing charges against electrical resistance. As voltage increases, the current should increase linearly for a particular resistance.
```{exercise}
:label: exercise:resistors:deliverable1
Explain how an increase in the current (number of charges flowing per second, not the speed of the charges) is a response to increasing voltage described by conservation of energy.
```

## Circuit Loop Rules
The word circuit comes from the idea that electronics make loops. A circuit or electronic loop must conserve energy. This leads to two circuit rules.
1.	The sum of voltages around a loop are zero, e.g., energy in from a battery equals energy out dissipated by a resistor.
2.	The current through a circuit or electronic loop is constant.
In [](#fig:resistors:singleR), on the left is a circuit shown as we might see in the lab with a battery and a resistor. On the right is the equivalent circuit diagram. We assume wires are ideal, with zero resistance.

```{exercise}
* In your lab notebook, make a note of what battery and resistor circuit diagrams look like. 
* Which side of the battery is +, and which side is -? 
* How is this polarity indicated in the circuit diagram on the right?
```

The resistors we will use have four or five colored bands on them. These bands quantify the resistance as shown in [](#fig:resistors:resistorBands).
