This book is a remix of various electronics lab manuals I have found online. Anyone is welcome to compile their own version including or excluding chapters. The original open-access files are found at https://github.com/OSTP/PhysicsArtofModelling/tex/. 

This version of the textbook is also open-access and can be found at https://github.com/troymessina/PhysicsArtOfModeling. The following chapters are included in the textbook:

1. [Preface](https://troymessina.github.io/ElectronicsLab/preface)
2. [Introduction](https://troymessina.github.io/ElectronicsLab/introduction)
3. [DC Resistor Circuits](https://troymessina.github.io/ElectronicsLab/resistors)
